 Spatial-Temporal Engine for Vehicle fleet Evolution (STEVE)

STEVE is based on three modules:
1. Regression analysis to return number of cars per geography area
2. Segmentation model to develop car fleet based on vehicle stock model in TEAM-UK
3. Energy assessment model

Developed by James Dixon (Transport Studies Unit, University of Oxford)
Original TEAM-UK methodology from Christian Brand (Transport Studies Unit, University of Oxford)
